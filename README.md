# HealthofThings (HoT) Project

## Project Overview

**HealthofThings (HoT)** is an IoT-driven health monitoring platform that collects, processes, and analyzes real-time health data from simulated medical devices. It enables healthcare providers to continuously monitor patients, detect anomalies, and receive real-time alerts, enhancing patient care and management.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-time health monitoring** using simulated IoT sensors.
- **Data visualization dashboards** for health trends and insights.
- **Anomaly detection** and alert generation.
- **Secure communication** via MQTT with TLS/SSL encryption.
- **Role-based user management** for healthcare providers, patients, and administrators.
- **End-to-end encryption** and security protocols.

## IoT Sensors

### 1.1 Simulated Sensors
We simulate the following health devices:
- **Heart Rate Monitor**
- **ECG (Electrocardiogram)**
- **Blood Pressure Monitor**
- **Blood Glucose Monitor**
- **Temperature Sensor**
- **Pulse Oximeter (SpO2)**
- **Activity Tracker**

### 1.2 Data Generation
- Use Python libraries like `NumPy` and `Pandas` to generate realistic health data.
- Simulate noise and anomalies to mimic real-world device behavior.

### 1.3 Data Format
Sensor data is generated in **JSON** format with fields such as:
- **Timestamp**
- **Sensor type**
- **Value**
- **Measurement unit**

---

## MQTT Configuration

### 2.1 MQTT Client Setup
- **Python-based sensors**: Use the `Paho MQTT` client for simulations.
- **Node.js backend**: Implement `MQTT.js` for integration.

### 2.2 Topic Structure
Follow a hierarchical topic structure: hot/patient/<patient_id>/vitals/<vital_type>

Additional topics for:
- **Alerts**
- **Device status**

### 2.3 QoS Levels
Use appropriate **Quality of Service (QoS)** levels for reliable data delivery.

### 2.4 Security
- Secure all MQTT communications with **TLS/SSL encryption**.
- Use **X.509 certificates** for client authentication.

---

## Web Application - Historian DB

### 3.1 Backend Development (Node.js)
- **Express.js** for RESTful API development.
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure user sessions.
- API Endpoints for:
  - Data retrieval from **Historian DB**.
  - **User management** with role-based access control (RBAC).
  - **Alert system** for real-time notifications.

### 3.2 Frontend Development (React)
- Create **responsive dashboards** for doctors, patients, and admins.
- **Custom charts** for visualizing health data.
- Key Features:
  - Multi-parameter health monitoring.
  - Diagnostic reporting based on data trends.
  - Appointment scheduling for patients and doctors.

### 3.3 Real-time Processing
- Use **WebSockets** for real-time data updates.
- Develop a **rules engine** to trigger alerts based on data anomalies.

### 3.4 Data Analysis
- Implement **trend analysis** and **anomaly detection**.
- Provide **custom insights** for healthcare professionals.

### 3.5 Security Considerations
- Ensure **end-to-end encryption** across all components.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and **two-factor authentication (2FA)**.
- **Audit logging** for system accountability.

---

## Deployment and Operations

### 4.1 Cloud Hosting
- Host the application on **AWS** or other cloud platforms.

### 4.2 Containerization
- Use **Docker** for containerizing all application components.

### 4.3 Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up system monitoring using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

### 4.4 Backup and Disaster Recovery
- Implement backup and recovery plans for the **Historian DB** and application data.

---

## Data Visualization

### 5.1 Interactive Charts
- Use **D3.js** or **Chart.js** for custom data visualizations.

### 5.2 Dashboards
- Provide real-time and historical data dashboards for patient monitoring.

### 5.3 Data Export
- Enable data export for further analysis and reporting.

---

## Scalability and Performance

### 6.1 Database Optimization
- Optimize **Historian DB queries** to handle large datasets efficiently.

### 6.2 Caching
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.

### 6.3 Horizontal Scalability
- Design for **horizontal scaling** to handle increased user demands and data loads.
